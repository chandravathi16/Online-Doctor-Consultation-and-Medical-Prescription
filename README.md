Online Consultation and Medical Prescription, a web application of encoded information and services exclusively meant 
to patients who connect with doctors and get the prescription from the doctor. The purpose of this application is to 
benefit people or patients during emergency cases who do not have doctors in their area, instead of going to a hospital 
which is too far away. Through login form patients can consult the doctor by explaining their health issues in a given 
text form or images and get the prescription from the doctor through email or whatsApp in printable format. This web 
application was implemented by using frontend languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks for the application and 
storing the patientâ€™s list into the database. This project was implemented using power BI. An admin can see the patients
view those who are suffering with common health issues in the form of visualisation. Also can see patients' lists in the
form of reports on each day. An admin will consult the doctor immediately and get an awareness about patients.
